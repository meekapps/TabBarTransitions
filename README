A demonstration of how to add animation when switching between tabs in a 
UITabBarController.

To change the transition type, change self.transitionStyle in viewDidLoad.
The available constants are "kTransitionTypeFade" and "kTransitionTypeSlide"

You can also change the animation duration by changing the constant 
"kAnimationDuration" - the default is 0.3 seconds.
